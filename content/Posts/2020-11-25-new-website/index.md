Welcome to a mostly tech blog. I created this to document my projects and ideas. I keep forgetting things and keep re-researching them. Hopefully this will help. I'm also hoping to improve my technical writing. 

I'll get more stuff up here eventually, maybe mess with the theme. Probably could make an email with my own domain at some point. More projects to add. 

I'm currently working on setting up Pfsense at home, but waiting on some more ethernet to attach a Unifi Lite AP. Then I want to finish automated encrypted backups to Backblaze. Once that's done, I'm planning to start self-hosting my password vault. I need to backup that too. Just a couple things I want to do. More to come as I go.
